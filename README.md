# Web Scraper for News Headlines

This project is **Task 3** of my Python Internship.  
The goal is to build a **web scraper** that automatically collects **top news headlines** from a public news website.

The script uses **requests** to download the webpage and **BeautifulSoup** to extract the headlines, which are then saved in a `.txt` file.
